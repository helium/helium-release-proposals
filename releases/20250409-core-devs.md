# Helium Release Proposal April 2025

## Summary

This document defines the release that will be deployed on or before April 9, 2025. As features are discussed in the community and developed by Helium Core Developers, this release document will be updated with context and explicit details on implementation.

Around the vote date, that's expected to kick off at March 27, 2025, this release will be finalized and presented to the community for approval. Note that all features that are not code complete will be moved to a future release or removed prior to vote.

## Roadmap Features

1. HIP-103 Urban Area Multiplier Adjustment
2. Hotspot Rewards Escrow

---

### (1) HIP-103 Urban Area Multiplier Adjustment

Reduce the PoC reward multipler for [HIP 103][hip-103] `C*` areas to `0.03`, to further incentivize deployements in high footfall, urban areas with businesses.


#### Motivation

The current Helium Mobile Proof of Coverage (PoC) system rewards Hotspots based on their deployment location as well as data transfer. The PoC rewards in the United States are adjusted using [HIP 103][hip-103] to reward hotspots in certain areas more than others.

The current allocation of multipliers allows non-urban, high footfall areas to earn PoC between with a multiplier between `0.03` and `0.4` depending on each of the layers. Given the number of residential deployments this is evidently too high.

Reducing all `C*` areas to multiplier `0.03` will remove some, but not all, of the PoC incentive for Hotspotsin those areas, moving more rewards to more desirable areas in the US.

#### Implementation

The implementation involves a simple change in the Mobile Verifier Oracle to adjust multipliers for the identified `C*` hex areas.

#### Alternatives Considered

* No Change
  - This will continue the existing rollout of Hotspots in approximately the same ratio as exist today, unnecessarily increasing and rewarding the number of hotspots providing little to no utility to the network
* Multiplier `0`
  - This would be a more drastic change to the network but is an option that may be considered once the effects of this proposal are observed.

#### Impact

* Incentivizes Hotspots to move to higher reward locations
* Shifts PoC rewards to hotspots in better locations

#### Drawbacks

* Fewer Hotspots in urban areas will reduce offload options
  - This should be counteracted by the implementation details of [HIP 140][hip-140] which indicates that carrier selection for a hotspot in any location will set the PoC multiplier back to `1`

### (2) Hotspot Rewards Escrow

Adds a 30 day rolling window rewards escrow for Helium Mobile Hotspots. This increases the "stake" a Hotspot Deployer has in the hotspot which can be burnt if the Hotspot is caught exploiting the Helium Network for rewards.

#### Motivation

As the cost of the Hotspots goes down with brownfield and self-service Data-Only Hotspots, the cost to game network rewards goes down very low. Today, a gaming hotspot (and all associated hotspots) will get banned when caught but in most cases the gaming has earned back the cost of the effective hardware cost "slash". With Brownfield and Data-Only hotspots the cost of a Hotspot goes to near zero which makes the cost to game effectively free. This is made worse by the ability generate a new Self-Serve Data-Only Hotspot very quickly.

Using a 30 rolling window rewards escrow will:

- Protect network from reward gaming and exploitation. Adding a 30 rolling window escrow adds 30 days worth of rewards as a slashable stake for a Hotspot.
- Allow sufficient time for activity verification
- Maintain simplicity by using existing claim infrastructure
- Ensure rewards correspond to legitimate network usage

#### Implementation

 No on-chain changes are needed for this feature.

The Mobile Rewards Indexer Oracle will need to maintain 30 days of pending rewards for a hotspot and post them as claimable using the existing mechanism on day 31.

The Pending Rewards Oracle will return all earned rewards whether claimable or not.

A new ingest ban report to "perma-ban" a hotspot will be created. This ban type does not expire. The Mobile Rewards Indexer will burn accumulated escrow rewards for the banned hotspot. The Mobile Verifier will no longer allocate rewards for a perma-banned hotspot.

Builder and Helium Wallet Applications will be modified to show claimable and earned rewards separately. The existing claim mechanism can be used for the claimable amount.

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Current System**
   - Immediate reward availability
   - Higher vulnerability to exploitation
   - No verification period
2. **Fixed Monthly Release**
   - Calendar-based release
   - Less flexible
   - More complex tracking

#### Impact

* Security Benefits
  - Extended verification window
  - Reduced gaming incentive when more is at stake
* Operator Experience
  - Consistent with existing claim process
  - No new interfaces to learn
  - Clear reward maturation timeline
* Economic Effects
  - More stable reward distribution
  - Reduced impact of gaming attempts
  - Better alignment with actual network value

#### Drawbacks

1. **Operational**
   - Initial 30-day delay for new operators
   - Longer wait for first rewards
   - Need to track reward aging
2. **Economic**
   - Delayed access to earned rewards
   - Impact on operator cash flow
   - Potential effect on operator participation
3. **Technical**
   - Additional reward aging tracking
   - Updates to application to separate Subscriber and Hotspot claiming logic
4. **Transition**
   - Migration period for current rewards
   - Clear communication needed
   - Operator education required

# Helium Release Proposal April 2025

## Summary

This document defines the release that will be deployed on or before April 9, 2025. As features are discussed in the community and developed by Helium Core Developers, this release document will be updated with context and explicit details on implementation.

Around the vote date, that's expected to kick off at March 27, 2025, this release will be finalized and presented to the community for approval. Note that all features that are not code complete will be moved to a future release or removed prior to vote.

## Roadmap Features

1. HIP-103 Urban Area Multiplier Adjustment
2. Upgrade to Anchor 31 and Solana 2+

---

### (1) HIP-103 Urban Area Multiplier Adjustment

Reduce the PoC reward multipler for [HIP 103][hip-103] `C*` areas to `0.03`, to further incentivize deployements in high footfall, urban areas with businesses.


#### Motivation

The current Helium Mobile Proof of Coverage (PoC) system rewards Hotspots based on their deployment location as well as data transfer. The PoC rewards in the United States are adjusted using [HIP 103][hip-103] to reward hotspots in certain areas more than others.

The current allocation of multipliers allows non-urban, high footfall areas to earn PoC between with a multiplier between `0.03` and `0.4` depending on each of the layers. Given the number of residential deployments this is evidently too high.

Reducing all `C*` areas to multiplier `0.03` will remove some, but not all, of the PoC incentive for Hotspotsin those areas, moving more rewards to more desirable areas in the US.

#### Implementation

The implementation involves a simple change in the Mobile Verifier Oracle to adjust multipliers for the identified `C*` hex areas.

#### Alternatives Considered

* No Change
  - This will continue the existing rollout of Hotspots in approximately the same ratio as exist today, unnecessarily increasing and rewarding the number of hotspots providing little to no utility to the network
* Multiplier `0`
  - This would be a more drastic change to the network but is an option that may be considered once the effects of this proposal are observed.

#### Impact

* Incentivizes Hotspots to move to higher reward locations
* Shifts PoC rewards to hotspots in better locations

#### Drawbacks

* Fewer Hotspots in urban areas will reduce offload options
  - This should be counteracted by the implementation details of [HIP 140][hip-140] which indicates that carrier selection for a hotspot in any location will set the PoC multiplier back to `1`

### (2) Upgrade to Anchor 31 and Solana 2+

Upgrade smart contracts to to Anchor 31 and Solana 2+ as part of regular maintenance. These are the latest versions
for the Solana ecosystem.


#### Motivation

Helium contracts are currently on Anchor 28 and Solana 1.16. These versions are outdated and need to be upgraded. The newest
versions include increases to performance and ergonomics of the sdks.

#### Implementation

The implementation involves upgrading the smart contracts to the latest versions of Anchor and Solana, and dealing with any and all issues that arise from this upgrade. 

#### Alternatives Considered

None, we must do this at some point.

#### Impact

The largest change from Anchor 28 to 31 are breaking changes to the on-chain IDL. Because there is only one address with the IDL, this creates an issue where old anchor 28 clients fail to parse the new IDL.

To mitigate this change, we are upgrading the RPC endpoint that all user-facing applications (wallet apps, etc) interact with to return the old IDLs when they detect an old client. We recommend that everyone providing third party tools to the network upgrade their typescript packages to 0.10.0 or later.

#### Drawbacks

None, other than the IDL issues stated above.

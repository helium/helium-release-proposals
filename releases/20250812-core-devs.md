### (1) Removal of Unstarted Boosted Hexes from the Mobile Network

#### Motivation  

This proposal aims to clean up the Mobile network by removing all unstarted boosted hexes. Since boosted hexes have largely not met expectations, this HRP removes unstarted hexes while still supporting deployers who depend on active boosted rewards to help fund their deployments.

As of July 2, 2025, the following are active boosted hexes with their expiration dates: 

| country | boost | count | expiration  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Mexico | 10 | 22740 | 2025-12-26 00:00:00+00 |
| Mexico | 100 | 1 | 2025-07-11 01:00:00+00 |
| United States | 5 | 11950 | 2026-01-14 00:00:00+00 |
| United States | 10 | 77 | 2025-12-20 00:00:00+00 |
| United States | 30 | 15 | 2025-12-10 00:00:00+00 |
| United States | 100 | 31 | 2025-12-10 00:00:00+00 |
| **Total Active Hexes** |  | **34814** |  |

The number of non activated boosted hexes:

| country | boost | count |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| United States | 100 | 135 |
| United States | 50 | 10 |
| United States | 30 | 139 |
| United States | 10 | 2369 |
| United States | 5 | 293113 |
| Mexico | 10 | 11240 |
| **Total Unstarted Hexes** |  | **307006** |

The boosted rewards constitute about 18% of the PoC pool today

#### Implementation

* A snapshot of all boosted hexes and their activation status will be taken on Aug 1, 2025\.   
* All boosted hexes identified in the snapshot will be removed from the chain as soon as this HRP is activated and their Solana account rent reclaimed.  
* No action is required for started hexes; they will continue to age out naturally.  
* Boost backend infrastructure can be decommissioned right after this HRP is activated.

#### Alternatives Considered

* Terminate all boosted hexes regardless of status. This approach wwas considered too heavy handed for legitimate deployers that are in boosted hexes and rely on the boosted rewards to fund deployments.

#### Impact and stakeholder Impact

* About 18% of the PoC pool will go back to non boosted deployments.
* This HRP affects deployers that were planning to deploy in booosted hexes - There are not many deployers gaming activating boosted hexes after the requirements for user observed user counts were raised. For deployers that are about to deploy in boosted hexes the grace period gives them time to activate the boosted hexes. 
* Deployers in Mexico could get affected but there are not accessible inactive boosted hexes and all the boosted areas are carrier offload tagged which means they will receive PoC rewards at the 1.0 multiple when deployed in those areas.

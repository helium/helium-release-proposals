### (1) HNT Token Net Emissions Smoothing

Smooth Net Emissions over time in alignment with the objectives first proposed for the Net Emissions Pool in HIP-20.

#### Motivation

HIP-20 introduced Capped [Net Emissions](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/hnt-token/#net-emissions). When HNT is burned, it is re-emitted up to a daily cap of approximately 1644 HNT, so that up to 50,000 HNT can be re-emitted every month, independent of halvenings, to sustain the long-term viability of rewards to network participants.

HIP-20 also proposed a Net Emissions Pool, which would smooth out the effects of large individual burn events ocurring infrequently. Without smoothing, if all HNT burn were concentrated on a single day of the month, Net Emissions would be capped at 1644 HNT on that day, and Net Emissions for the entire month would be limited to 1644 HNT rather than 50,000.

The Net Emissions Pool is currently not implemented. Therefore, less HNT is currently being re-minted after burn than was proposed in HIP-20. Over time, after halvenings, this could impair the payment of Data Transfer rewards to Hotspots, as well as other network rewards.

Therefore, a smoothing function will now be implemented to align with the goals of the original Net Emissions Pool.

#### Implementation

The smoothing function follows the same principle as the function defined in HIP-141 for the Protocol Score.

Every day, a Net Emissions Target is calculated, which takes into account the daily burn of HNT, and the Net Emissions Target of the previous day. The target amount of HNT is re-emitted as Net Emissions, up to the cap of 1644 HNT.

```
net_emissions_target(today) = net_emissions_target(yesterday) * 6/7 + hnt_burn(today) * 1/7
hnt_net_emissions(today) = min(net_emissions_target(today), 1644)
```

With this smoothing function, Net Emissions remain limited to a maximum of 50,000 HNT/month under all circumstances, while the effect of occasional large burns is distributed over time.

#### Alternatives Considered

We could create a more advanced smoothing based on true averages, but this would incur more complexity and cost in the smart contracts.

#### Impact

This feature will help smooth out the net emissions and reduce the impact of large swings in emissions.

#### Stakeholders affected

HNT Holders. Daily HNT emissions recipients.
Affects, both Mobile and IoT networks by slightly changing the daily emissions to HNT recipients.

---

### (2) Re-implementation of Not Emitted HNT tokens

Burn HNT tokens that oracles count as not emitted, and do not count them towards Net Emissions.

#### Motivation

When the protocol migrated to HIP-138, we stopped claiming "not emitted" HNT tokens to keep from effecting Net-Emissions. This was a temporary solution, and we will now re-implement this feature.

#### Implementation

Each epoch, the protocol will track the change in not emitted HNT tokens and subtract them from the total amount of burned HNT that counts towards Net-Emissions.

#### Alternatives Considered

None, this is the most efficient solution.

#### Impact

This will correct the total HNT supply. There will be a larger burn when the feature is initially released, accounting for all not emitted HNT since the migration to HIP-138.

#### Stakeholders affected

HNT Holders will see a reduction in total supply.

---

### (3) ED25519 Signature Instruction Support for Lazy-Distributor

Add support for using the ed25519 signature instruction in the lazy-distributor to set the current rewards on Hotspots, as an alternative to the current method that requires the oracle be a signer on the Solana transaction itself.

#### Motivation

The current implementation of oracle claiming requires the following steps:

1. Client forms a transaction that sets the current lifetime rewards on the Hotspot, and then claims the difference between the current lifetime rewards and the last total claimed rewards.
2. POST to the oracle to sign the transaction
3. The oracle submits the transaction to the network
4. If block hash expires, re-run from step (1)

The issue with this approach is that with the oracle as a signer, the transaction must be re-signed every time the block hash expires. This is not just a problem for developer experience, it also makes it impossible to introduce automation around claiming rewards. It also puts unnecessary extra load on the oracle servers.

By using the ed25519 signature, the oracle can sign a message once that can be submitted at the client's convenience. Allowing for automation around claiming rewards, and allowing clients to use standard Solana functions like `send_and_confirm_transactions_in_parallel`.

#### Implementation

A new `set_current_rewards_v2` endpoint will be added to the lazy-distributor smart contract. This endpoint will expect an ed25519 signature of the current rewards in the instruction before the set_current_rewards call is made. It will use the `instructions` sysvar to verify.

The endpoint will accept two types of signed messages:

1. A standard message stating the asset and current rewards
2. A tuktuk compiled transaction that sets the current rewards on the Hotspot

Tuktuk is a new automation framework being built by the Helium Core Developers. It will allow for the creation of automated workflows that can be deployed to the Helium network. For example, this can allow Hotspot deployers to set their rewards to claim on an automated schedule, without the need to manually sign and submit transactions.

#### Alternatives Considered

The alternative is the current implementation, which will not be going away.

#### Impact

This will improve the user experience on the network, allowing deployers to fund an automated schedule for claiming rewards, and allowing clients to use standard Solana functions like `send_and_confirm_transactions_in_parallel`.

#### Stakeholders affected

Daily HNT emissions recipients who do large amounts of Hotspot claims on any network.

### (4) Switch Mobile Hotspot Onboarding Fees to Data Credits

Mobile Hotspots currently require burning a dollar denominated amount of MOBILE tokens to onboard, as detailed in [HIP 96.](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0096-wifi-ap-onboarding-structure.md#onboarding-fee-structure) This will be switched to burning the equivalent dollar denominated amount of Data Credits.

#### Motivation

Mobile Hotspots are currently the only Hotspots that require burning a dollar denominated amount of Mobile tokens to onboard. With the migration back to HNT, this is no longer necessary.

#### Implementation

The current onboarding fees are as follows:

- Wi-Fi Indoor: $10 DC, $10 MOBILE
- Wi-Fi Outdoor: $10 DC, $20 MOBILE
- Wi-Fi Data Only: $1 DC, $1 MOBILE

These will be updated to the following:

- Wi-Fi Indoor: $20 DC
- Wi-Fi Outdoor: $30 DC
- Wi-Fi Data Only: $2 DC

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

#### Stakeholders affected

Mobile Wi-Fi hotspot makers no longer need to hold mobile for onboarding.
Mobile token holders - less usage and utility.
HNT token holders - more burn and utility.

### (5) Switch Mobile Hex-boosting Fees to Data Credits

Service Provider hex-boosting currently requires burning a dollar denominated amount of MOBILE tokens as defined in [HIP 84](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0084-service-provider-hex-boosting.md#detailed-explanation). This will be switched to burning the equivalent dollar denominated amount of Data Credits.

#### Motivation

In migrating back to HNT, we should switch all fees to DC.

#### Implementation

The current hex-boosting fee is $0.005 in MOBILE per res12 hex per month. This will be switched to $0.005 in DC per res12 hex per month.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

#### Stakeholders affected

Mobile Service Providers makers no longer need to hold mobile for boosting.
Mobile token holders - less usage and utility.
HNT token holders - more burn and utility.

---

### (6) Switch Mobile Service Provider Stake to HNT

Service providers currently stake 500m MOBILE tokens as defined in [HIP 53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview). This will be refunded, and new stakes will require 100,000 HNT.

#### Motivation

In migrating back to HNT, we should switch all stakes to HNT.

#### Implementation

An endpoint will be implemented in the mobile-entity-manager smart contract that refunds the current MOBILE stake if the HNT stake is present.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

#### Stakeholders affected

Existing Mobile Service Providers and Mobile Manufacturers makers will have to buy HNT to continue staking.
Mobile token holders - increased liquidity when stakes are closed.

---

### (7) Switch Mobile Manufacturer Stake to HNT

Manufacturers currently stake 50m MOBILE tokens as defined in [HIP 53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview). This will be refunded, and new stakes will require 10,000 HNT.

#### Motivation

In migrating back to HNT, we should switch all stakes to HNT.

#### Implementation

An endpoint will be implemented in the helium-entity-manager smart contract that refunds the current MOBILE stake if the HNT stake is present.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

#### Stakeholders affected

Existing Mobile Service Providers and Mobile Manufacturers makers will have to buy HNT to continue staking.
Mobile token holders - increased liquidity when stakes are closed.

### (8) Allow Automation of locked HNT Position Rewards Claims

Allow users to eliminate the need to sign and claim their delegation rewards on a regular basis, instead allowing the tuktuk automation framework to claim rewards on their behalf.

#### Motivation

Currently, a user must sign to claim their delegation rewards. If a user wants to automate the claiming of their rewards, it is not possible without giving up their private key. Often, users wait long periods of time between claiming, and end up having to sign and send dozens of transactions to claim their rewards.

This change will allow both the user and tuktuk to sign to claim rewards. Tuktuk will only sign to claim rewards for positions that opt-in to and pay the fees for the automation. This will give users the opt-in ability to a better experience.

#### Implementation

A `payer` account will be added to the `claim_rewards_v1` transaction. If this `payer` account is the tuktuk signer, the `position_authority` will not be required as a signer. Otherwise, the `position_authority` will still be required to sign.

The tuktuk signer is automated via the `hpl-crons` smart contract, which will only queue tasks to claim position rewards for positions that opt-in to and pay the fees for the automation.

#### Alternatives Considered

This is a net-new feature. The alternative would be to continue with the current implementation, which requires users to sign and claim their rewards on a regular basis.

#### Drawbacks

Tuktuk claiming is slightly more expensive than manual claims, so users will pay a small additional fee. This fee is around 0.00001 SOL (10,000 lamports) per position per transaction. Over a year, this will add up to 0.00365 SOL, which is less than $1 at current SOL prices.

#### Impact

This will improve the user experience on the network, users to automate the claiming of their rewards.

#### Stakeholders affected

Daily HNT emissions recipients who do large amounts of Locked token delegation claims on any network.

### (9) Mobile Service Provider Overrides

Allow service providers to select hexes that will have an oracle multiplier of 1.0 regardless of the HIP-103 assignments.

#### Motivation

[HIP 103][hip-103] defines several scenarios that cause a resolution 12 h3 hex to have a oracle multiplier below 1.0. This lowers the Proof-of-Coverage rewards for any Hotspots covering this hex. This new dataset will give Service Providers the ability to override the HIP-103 multiplier with a value of 1.0.

#### Implementation

A new dataset of selected resolution 12 hexes will be supplied to the mobile-verifier via a public s3 bucket. Any hexes marked in this dataset will have a oracle multiplier of 1.0. At this point the multiplier of 1.0 is hard coded and cannot be chosen by the service provider.

This change will have no affect on any hex that is also a service provider boosted hex([HIP 84][hip-84]) as those hexes already override HIP-103 multipliers with a hardcoded value of 1.0.

[hip-103]: https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0103-oracle-hex-boosting.md
[hip-84]: https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0084-service-provider-hex-boosting.md

#### Impact

Service providers have improved control of their rewards distribution.

#### Stakeholders affected

Mobile hotspots selected for service provider boosting may see increased rewards.

### (10) Remove HNT/MOBILE/IOT Freeze Authorities

Remove the freeze authorities for HNT, MOBILE, and IOT.

#### Motivation

The freeze authorities for HNT, MOBILE, and IOT are currently set to a PDA of the helium-sub-daos smart contract. These were taken in case the protocol ever needed to freeze these tokens, for example, for escrowless staking.

It is now clear that the protocol will not need these authorities, and any functionality that would require them can be implemented in other ways. As such, for the sake of trust, we should remove these authorities. Chain analysis tools often flag this authority as a potential source of trust issues, as it can be used nefariously.

#### Implementation

A temporary endpoint will be added to the helium-sub-daos smart contract to remove these authorities using the spl-token `SetAuthority` instruction.

#### Impact

There is no impact to the current functionality of the protocol.

#### Stakeholders affected

None

### (11) Remove MOBILE/IOT Mint Authorities

Remove the mint authorities for MOBILE and IOT.

#### Motivation

Because these tokens are no longer in use by the protocol, new tokens are no longer emitted. As such, the protocol should be removed as the mint authority. This will aid chain analysis tools in identifying that no new tokens will ever be minted.

#### Implementation

A temporary endpoint will be added to the helium-sub-daos smart contract to remove these authorities using the spl-token `SetAuthority` instruction.

#### Impact

There is no impact to the current functionality of the protocol. However, it is worth noting that these tokens will never again be allowed to be minted. This action is permanent.

#### Stakeholders affected

None

### (12) Switch LoRaWAN OUI/DevAddr Managment Fees to Data Credits

LoRaWAN OUI/DevAddr management currently requires burning a dollar denominated amount of IOT as detailed in [HIP 116.](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0116-lorawan-device-address-price-adjustment.md) This will switch to burning the equivalent dollar denominated amount of Data Credits.

#### Motivation

With the migration back to HNT, this is no longer necessary.

#### Implementation

The transition from IOT to Data Credits for LoRaWAN OUI/DevAddr management fees will be detailed in an upcoming HRP. This change aligns with the protocol's broader initiative to consolidate token utilities back to HNT.

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

#### Stakeholders affected

None

## Summary

This document defines the release that will be deployed on or before March 1, 2025. As features are discussed in the community and developed by Helium Core Developers, this release document will be updated with context and explicit details on implementation.

Around the vote date, that's expected to kick off at February 19, 2025, this release will be finalized and presented to the community for approval. Note that all features that are not code complete will be moved to a future release or removed prior to vote.

## Roadmap Features

### Net Emissions Smoothing

Smooth net emissions with a one week smoothing factor. This is consistent with the HIP-20 established Net Emissions Pool.

#### Motivation

 Currently, Net Emissions are calculated on a daily basis and are subject to large swings as carriers purchase DC in bulk. The original
 Helium L1 had a smoothing system for net emissions, this will re-introduce this feature in the Solana implementation.

#### Implementation

This feature will work similar to the smoothing that occurs on V-score split percentages for the IoT and Mobile subnetworks.

```
net_emissions_today_smoothed = (net_emissions_yesterday_smoothed * 6/7) + (net_emissions_today * 1/7)
```

#### Alternatives Considered

We could create a more advanced smoothing based on true averages, but this would incur more complexity and cost in the smart contracts.

#### Impact

This feature will help smooth out the net emissions and reduce the impact of large swings in emissions.

### Re-implementation of Not Emitted tokens

Burn HNT tokens that oracles count as not emitted, and do not count them towards Net Emissions.

#### Motivation

When the protocol migrated to HIP-138, we stopped claiming "not emitted" HNT tokens to keep from effecting Net-Emissions. This was a temporary solution, and we will now re-implement this feature.

#### Implementation

Each epoch, the protocol will track the change in not emitted HNT tokens and subtract them from the total amount of burned HNT that counts towards Net-Emissions.

#### Alternatives Considered

None, this is the most efficient solution.

#### Impact

This will correct the total HNT supply. There will be a larger burn when the feature is initially released, accounting for all not emitted HNT since the migration to HIP-138.

### ED25519 Signature Instruction Support for Lazy-Distributor

Add support for using the ed25519 signature instruction in the lazy-distributor to set the current rewards on hotspots, as an alternative to the current method that requires the oracle be a signer on the Solana transaction itself.

#### Motivation

The current implementation of oracle claiming requires the following steps:

  1. Client forms a transaction that sets the current lifetime rewards on the hotspot, and then claims the difference between the current lifetime rewards and the last total claimed rewards.
  2. POST to the oracle to sign the transaction
  3. The oracle submits the transaction to the network
  4. If blockhash expires, re-run from step (1)

The issue with this approach is that with the oracle as a signer, the transaction must be re-signed every time the blockhash expires.
This is not just a problem for developer experience, it also makes it impossible to introduce automation around claiming rewards. It also puts unecessary extra load on the oracle servers.

By using the ed25519 signature, the oracle can sign a message once that can be submitted at the client's convenience. Allowing for automation around claiming rewards, and allowing clients to use standard Solana functions like `send_and_confirm_transactions_in_parallel`.

#### Implementation

A new `set_current_rewards_v2` endpoint will be added to the lazy-distributor smart contract. This endpoint will expect an ed25519 signature of the current rewards in the instruction before the set_current_rewards call is made. It will use the `instructions` sysvar to verify.

The endpoint will accept two types of signed messages:

  1. A standard message stating the asset and current rewards
  2. A tuktuk compiled transaction that sets the current rewards on the hotspot

Tuktuk is a new automation framework being built by the Helium Core Developers. It will allow for the creation of automated workflows that can be deployed to the Helium network. For example, this can allow Hotspot deployers to set their rewards to claim on an automated schedule, without the need to manually sign and submit transactions.

#### Alternatives Considered

The alternative is the current implementation, which will not be going away.

#### Impact

This will improve the user experience on the network, allowing deployers to fund an automated schedule for claiming rewards, and allowing clients to use standard Solana functions like `send_and_confirm_transactions_in_parallel`.

### Switch Mobile Hotspot Onboarding Fees to Data Credits

Mobile hotspots currently require burning a dollar denominated amount of MOBILE tokens to onboard. This will be switched to burning the equivalent dollar denominated amount of Data Credits.

#### Motivation

Mobile hotspots are currently the only hotspots that require burning a dollar denominated amount of Mobile tokens to onboard. With the migration back to HNT, this is no longer necessary.

#### Implementation

The current onboarding fees are as follows:

  - Wifi Indoor: $10 DC, $10 MOBILE
  - Wifi Outdoor: $20 DC, $20 MOBILE
  - Wifi Data Only: $1 DC, $1 MOBILE

These will be updated to the following:

  - Wifi Indoor: $20 DC
  - Wifi Outdoor: $40 DC
  - Wifi Data Only: $2 DC

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

### Switch Hexboosting Fees to Data Credits

Service Provider hexboosting currently requires burning a dollar denominated amount of MOBILE tokens. This will be switched to burning the equivalent dollar denominated amount of Data Credits.

#### Motivation

In migrating back to HNT, we should switch all fees to DC.

#### Implementation

The current hexboosting fee is $0.005 in MOBILE per res12 hex per month. This will be switched to $0.005 in DC per res12 hex per month.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

### Switch Service Provider Stake to HNT

Service providers currently stake 500m MOBILE tokens. This will be refunded, and a new stakes will require 100,000 HNT.

#### Motivation

In migrating back to HNT, we should switch all stakes to HNT.

#### Implementation

An endpoint will be implemented in the mobile-entity-manager smart contract that refunds the current MOBILE stake if the HNT stake is present.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

### Switch Manufacturer Stake to HNT

Manufacturers currently stake 50m MOBILE tokens. This will be refunded, and a new stakes will require 10,000 HNT.

#### Motivation

In migrating back to HNT, we should switch all stakes to HNT.

#### Implementation

An endpoint will be implemented in the helium-entity-manager smart contract that refunds the current MOBILE stake if the HNT stake is present.

### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

### Allow Tuktuk Position Rewards Claims

MOBILE hotspots currently require burning a dollar denominated amount of MOBILE tokens to onboard. This will be switched to burning the equivalent dollar denominated amount of DC.

#### Motivation

MOBILE hotspots are currently the only hotspots that require burning a dollar denominated amount of MOBILE tokens to onboard. With the migration back to HNT, this is no longer necessary.

#### Implementation

The current onboarding fees are as follows:

  - Wifi Indoor: $10 DC, $10 MOBILE
  - Wifi Outdoor: $20 DC, $20 MOBILE
  - Wifi Data Only: $1 DC, $1 MOBILE

These will be updated to the following:

  - Wifi Indoor: $20 DC
  - Wifi Outdoor: $40 DC
  - Wifi Data Only: $2 DC

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

This will get us closer to purely using HNT.

# Helium Release Proposal February 2026

## Summary

This document defines the release that will be deployed on or before February 16th, 2026. As features are discussed in the community and developed by Helium Core Developers, this release document will be updated with context and explicit details on implementation.

Around the vote date, which is expected to kick off around February 6th, 2026, this release will be finalized and presented to the community for approval. Note that all features that are not code complete will be moved to a future release or removed prior to vote.

## Roadmap Features

1. Remove CDR Verification Requirement for PoC Eligibility

### (1) Remove CDR Verification Requirement for PoC Eligibility

#### Motivation

[HIP-131][hip-131] and [HIP-133][hip-133] introduced CDR (Call Detail Record) verification as a requirement for Hotspots to be eligible for Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) rewards. This was an anti-gaming measure to ensure Hotspots were legitimately deployed and serving real users.

Since the implementation of [HIP-147][hip-147] (Mobile Data Eats First), data transfer rewards are allocated before PoC rewards from the combined pool. Growth in carrier offload data, combined with depressed token prices, has resulted in no PoC rewards being distributed for several months. The CDR verification requirement now gates access to rewards that do not exist.

[HIP-145][hip-145] (Demand Sampling) introduced a new method for estimating Hotspot utility based on MNO subscriber connection attempts. Demand Sampling data informs carrier offload selection decisions but is not currently designed as a gating factor for PoC rewards. As noted in HIP-145, CDR requirements for U.S. Hotspots would be deprecated.

This release removes CDR verification as a PoC eligibility requirement. Other eligibility requirements remain in effect.

#### Implementation

The Mobile Oracles will be updated to remove the CDR verification check from the PoC eligibility evaluation. Hotspots previously ineligible due to missing CDRs will become eligible for PoC rewards (when available) after this change is deployed.

#### Alternatives Considered

- Keep CDR requirement: Adds friction for deployers with no practical benefit when PoC rewards are unavailable.
- Replace with Demand Sampling as a gate: Demand Sampling serves a different purpose (carrier offload selection) and is not currently designed as a reward eligibility gate.

#### Impact and Stakeholder Impact

- Deployers: Reduced friction. No longer need to generate CDRs to be eligible for PoC rewards.
- Service Providers: No change to carrier offload selection, which uses Demand Sampling data.

#### Drawbacks

- Removes one anti-gaming mechanism. However, gaming PoC when no PoC rewards are distributed provides no benefit to bad actors.

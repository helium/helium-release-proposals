## Roadmap Features

1. Reallocating Mobile Mapping Rewards

---

### (1) Reallocating Mobile Mapping Rewards

#### Motivation

As part of optimizing allocation of HNT emissions, [HIP-148](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0148-reallocate-mobile-mapping-rewards.md) proposes removing mapping rewards for Helium Mobile and reallocating those rewards to the Service Provider Rewards Pool and Data Rewards Pool. Additionally, the HIP proposes to repeal several prior HIPs that are no longer necessary given the removal of mapping rewards, and allocate Oracle Operator rewards to the Service Provider Rewards Pool.

Since this HIP was approved by the community, this release will implement the changes defined in HIP-148.

#### Implementation

This is not a complex change since the current system already supports changing allocation to various rewards pools.

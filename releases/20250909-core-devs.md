## Roadmap Features

1. Retire Pyth Sponsored Price Feeds for Minting Data Credits
2. 
---

### (1)

The protocol team plans to retire the pyth sponsored price feed in favor of the client-side pull-based pyth model.

#### Motivation

The current `mintDataCreditsV0` smart contract endpoint uses Pyth sponsored price feeds. This is an outdated way of accessing prices, and has since been replaced by a pull-based method where the user of the endpoint writes the most recent price in the same transaction as using the price. This is part of routine maintainance to make sure helium-program-library is adhering to most recent best-practice.

#### Implementation

The pull-based price updates are still `PriceUpdateV2` accounts, so minimal changes to the smart contracts are necessary. Instead of validating the solana account at a specific address, the contracts will instead validate the feed ID on the price update.

This change is backwards compatible -- existing clients will continue to function until the sponsored price feed is turned off. We intend to leave the sponsored price feed running until we can ensure all consumers have switched.

#### Alternatives Considered

Leaving the sponsored price feed as is; however that incurs a cost of 5 SOL per month.

#### Impact and Stakeholder Impact

Saves 5 SOL/month in protocol costs.

#### Drawbacks

Anyone with a user interface that mints data credits will need to update that user interface to use the new price update methodology. They will need to do so before the sponsored price feed is retired.

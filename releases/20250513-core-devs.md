# Helium Release Proposal May 2025

## Summary

This document defines the release that will be deployed on or before May 13th, 2025. As features are discussed in the community and developed by Helium Core Developers, this release document will be updated with context and explicit details on implementation.

Around the vote date, that's expected to kick off at April 30th, 2025, this release will be finalized and presented to the community for approval. Note that all features that are not code complete will be moved to a future release or removed prior to vote.

## Roadmap Features

1. IoT Metrics Service
2. Add Change Delegation to Helium Sub Daos Program
3. Add Burn endpoint to Circuit Breakers Program

### (1) IoT Metrics Service

Analyze traffic on the Helium IoT Network with the goal of more closely approximating the number of active devices transferring data through the network.

#### Motivation

As a permissionless and encrypted protocol, the IoT Network's implementation of LoRaWAN does not have a native method to count the number of devices that are active on the network. While counting individual messages (via packet reports) has been available in the post-L1 implementation of the IoT Network, understanding unique devices has remained elusive.

In an effort to unify messaging between the IoT and Mobile networks, sourcing a more accurate count of daily active devices will allow the IoT Network to stand side-by-side with the Mobile network in stats reflecting the impact of the Helium Network globally.

#### Implementation

The Helium Packet Router (HPR) is a set of globally distributed servers tasked with handling this traffic. It essentially acts as a bridge between Hotspots and the LoRaWAN Network Servers (LNS) where those devices are managed. The metrics service will operate alongside HPRs using a gRPC connection.

The metrics service will count unique session keys that handle packets, validating liveliness of session keys onboarded to OUIs via the Config Service. For operators not leveraging the Session Key Filter (SKF), the DevAddr of the device will be used to interpret the device count.

It is important to note that these processes will not reveal an absolute number of active devices and are likely to under-represent total active devices.  
Some cases where this service will under-represent active devices:
- A device may be online and onboarded but not transfer a message through Helium on the given day.
- A DevAddr may handle multiple devices and not leverage SKFs.

The data will be served as part of a network presentation view on the World Explorer, world.helium.com.

#### Alternatives Considered

* It is somewhat possible to estimate the number of active devices by applying an average count of messages sent per device and dividing that among the total number of messages sent in a day. However, the frequency of transmission from LoRaWAN devices varies widely â€“ ranging from once a day to several times per minute. Without a picture of the types of devices onboarded, estimating the transmission rate is highly inaccurate.
* Make no change.

#### Impact

* The core team does not expect any impact on the performance of HPR or message transfer on the network.
* Dashboards will be able to begin reporting device counts active on the network.

#### Drawbacks

* None

### (2) Add Change Delegation to Helium Sub Daos

Add change delegation to the Helium Sub Daos on-chain program.

#### Motivation

In order to change delegation currently, a staker must (1) claim all outstanding rewards, (2) undelegate (forfeiting the days rewards), (3) delegate to the new subnetwork. This is a UX pain point, and can be solved by a change delegation endpoint.

#### Implementation

The new endpoint is an atomic delegation change while preserving rewards state.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

* The core team does not expect any impact to the community. This should be a UX improvement that promotes more flexibility.

#### Drawbacks

* None

### (3) Add Burn endpoint to Circuit Breakers

Add a burn endpoint to the Circuit Breakers.

#### Motivation

In order to automate delegation rewards claims, the Helium Sub Daos on-chain program needs a way to burn HNT for positions that have not voted (as defined in HIP-141) . The current mechanism of burning requires the position holder to sign after the rewards have been transferred. This change will allow the program to burn the HNT instead of transferring it, saving compute units and allowing automation through systems like tuktuk.

#### Implementation

The new endpoint will be added to the Circuit Breaker program, and the implementation of the burn will be changed in the Helium Sub Daos program.

#### Alternatives Considered

None

#### Impact

* The core team does not expect any impact to end users. Functionally, the operations are equivalent.

#### Drawbacks

* None

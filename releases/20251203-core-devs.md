# Helium Release Proposal December 2025

## Summary

This document defines the release that will be deployed on or before December 3rd, 2025. As features are discussed in the community and developed by Helium Core Developers, this release document will be updated with context and explicit details on implementation.

Around the vote date, which is expected to kick off around November 26th 2025, this release will be finalized and presented to the community for approval. Note that all features that are not code complete will be moved to a future release or removed prior to vote.

## Roadmap Features

1. Remove rent subsidy for HNT `RecipientV0` structs

### (1) Remove rent subsidy for HNT `RecipientV0` structs

#### Motivation

As part of the migration from MOBILE / IOT to HNT, all Hotspots earning rewards needed new on-chain struct (`RecipientV0`) to track their claimable rewards. These Hotspots retain MOBILE / IOT `RecipientV0`s, but those are not able to be used for HNT as they are tracking unclaimed subnetwork token rewards.

The protocol (specifically Nova Labs) has been paying the SOL rent for all new HNT `RecipientV0`s, as it was decided that Hotspot deployers had already paid once and should not have to pay again. It has now been nearly a year since the change, and all deployers have had ample opportunity to claim rewards and in so doing, claim this rent subsidy. As such, this subsidy is more often paying for new Hotspots than it is for legacy MOBILE/IOT earners.

As of this HRP, core developers will remove the subsidy. New Hotspots can pay for their recipient structs using the small amount of SOL sent by the maker to fresh wallets onboarding a Hotspot.


#### Implementation

An environment variable on the oracle server controls whether the server's keypair will pay for new `RecipientV0` structs. This will be set to false.

#### Alternatives Considered

 - Continue subsidizing rent: Given the history of this protocol change, we do not believe this is an obligation that should continue given the cost (0.00242208 SOL per hotspot) the prolonged grace period, and the fact that makers are already seeding fresh wallets on onboards. 

#### Impact and Stakeholder Impact

- Makers will have a higher rent burdain (this is already covered in the default 0.02 SOL the onboarding server has makers send to fresh wallets).
- IOT deployers under makers with insufficient SOL will need to pay rent again for `RecipientV0` structs, as it was a year ago. 

#### Drawbacks

- May decrease IOT deployments as there is a one-time cost of ~$0.40 in rent to claim rewards.
